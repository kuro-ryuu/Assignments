Signs of love overshadowed by dreams
Baby, don't worry coz you ain't alone
Only time running days without nights
Tears pass through
He said, I'm the one who's got to leave
I said, nobody's really got to leave coz
I don't hear enough explnation
All I need is admiration
Big frustration bro he goes
Life is short we gave a shot
But it didn't work honey coz
We had a whole lot going on and on
Signs of love overshadowed by dreams
Baby, don't worry coz you ain't alone
Only time running days without nights
Tears pass through
Every time look at the picture in frame
Gaze in fasciniation so hard
You still think that is nothing but love
Rain still falls
